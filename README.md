# WebAccessibility
A refactoring of a website to optimize for Accessibility.

I was assigned to refactor this website to optimize for accessibility. Over the course of this project I accomplished the following.

Added semantic HTML tags including header, main, aside, section, nav, and footer tags.
Added alt tags for all images.
Changed the navigation to a sequential ordered list.
Added a descriptive and concise page title.
Cleaned up HTML and CSS code by removing unnecessary classes in favor of altering semantic tags directly, and grouped remaining CSS classes with matching code.
